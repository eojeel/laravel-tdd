## Build A Laravel App With TDD

It's time to take the techniques we learned in Laravel From Scratch, and put them to good use building your first real-world application. Together, we'll leverage TDD to create Birdboard: a minimal Basecamp-like project management app.

This series will give us a wide range of opportunities to pull up our sleeves and test our Laravel chops. As always, we start from scratch

 ## Run tests
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan test

## Testing
alias v="./vendor/bin/sail"

v artisan test --filter ***
